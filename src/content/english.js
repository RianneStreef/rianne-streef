  aboutMe:
    "In 2020 I decided to turn this negative COVID situation into a positive experience and I started my education in web design and development. Driven by my curiosity to create and innovate and my passion for logic and coding I applied at OpenClassrooms. Fascinated by new ideas, both in terms of development in familiar fields as in new subjects. This, and being client oriented makes me widely deployable. Now I have completed my education I want to show people what I am capable of. Work in a team of people that are innovative, enthusiastic and communicative. Motivated and ambitious to further develop my skills and learn new techniques.",
